Hi!

A blog has been in my head for quite some time, but I never had the “just do it” attitude. I wanted to build a website from scratch, using some kind of static site generator and an automated publishing mechanism.

I never decided what to do, and I got stuck in an endless loop of decision postponement.

After reading a nice article about this topic:
- [Static site generators to watch in 2021](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27428062)
- [Publisher: a tooling to automate the process to publish my blog posts](https://leandrotk.github.io/2020/04/publisher-a-tooling-to-automate-the-process-to-publish-my-blog-posts/index.html)

I decided to just start writing and make decisions along the way.

Eventually, I want to write an article comparing static site generator options, and later migrate the blog to the one that best fits my needs.
