Born in the early 80s, I grew up during the golden era of arcade machines. For a long time, that was the closest I got to a “computer.” It wasn’t until the turn of the millennium that I finally had the chance to work with real computers.

I’ve now spent the last 15 years writing code for a living. This industry moves fast, and we’ve weathered countless transformations. Now, we are facing a new one where much of the code might not be written by us anymore. On this site, I share what I’ve learned about building systems that last, by mastering the foundations we can work beyond the code and focus on what humans do best: solving the hard problems and driving innovation.
